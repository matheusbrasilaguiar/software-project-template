## How to Update This File

When making changes to the template, add an entry under `[Unreleased]` using one of the following categories:

- **Added** — new files or sections introduced to the template
- **Changed** — changes to existing content or structure
- **Deprecated** — sections or files that will be removed in a future version
- **Removed** — files or sections that were removed
- **Fixed** — corrections to placeholders, links, or instructions

When releasing a new version, move the contents of `[Unreleased]` to a new versioned section, tag the commit in Git, and reset `[Unreleased]` to empty.

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "release: v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```
