# Objectives and Scope

## Primary Objective

> TODO: Write the single most important goal of this project in one or two sentences.
> This should answer: "What is the core outcome this project must deliver?"
> Example: "Enable customers to self-serve their order management without contacting support."

---

## Secondary Objectives

> TODO: List additional goals that are important but not the primary focus.
> Each objective should be specific and outcome-oriented, not a list of features.
> Example: "Reduce average order processing time by automating manual steps."

| # | Objective |
|---|-----------|
| 1 | TODO |
| 2 | TODO |

---

## In Scope

> TODO: List everything that this project will deliver or address.
> Be explicit — anything not listed here is assumed to be out of scope.
> Focus on capabilities and outcomes, not technical implementation.

| # | Description |
|---|-------------|
| 1 | TODO |
| 2 | TODO |

---

## Out of Scope

> TODO: Explicitly list what this project will NOT cover.
> This is one of the most important sections — it prevents misaligned expectations and scope creep.
> Example: "Mobile application support is out of scope for the initial release."

| # | Description |
|---|-------------|
| 1 | TODO |
| 2 | TODO |

---

## Success Criteria

> TODO: Define how success will be measured at the end of the project.
> Each criterion should be observable and, where possible, measurable.
> Example: "Users can complete the full onboarding flow in under 5 minutes without assistance."

| # | Criterion | How to Measure |
|---|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | TODO | TODO |
| 2 | TODO | TODO |

---

## Definition of Done

> TODO: Describe what "done" means for this project.
> This applies at the project level, not at the individual task level.
> A good Definition of Done typically includes: core features delivered, documentation complete, tests passing, and the solution validated with real users or stakeholders.
