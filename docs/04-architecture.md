# Architecture

## Architectural Style

> TODO: Describe the overall architectural style adopted for this project.
> Example: "Monolithic", "Microservices", "Serverless", "Event-Driven", "Layered (MVC)", "Hexagonal", etc.
> Explain briefly why this style was chosen over alternatives. If the decision was formally recorded, link to the corresponding ADR.

**Style:** TODO

**Rationale:** TODO

**Related ADR:** [ADR-TODO](adr/TODO.md)

## High-Level Overview

> TODO: Describe the system at a high level — its main parts and how they interact.
> This should be understandable without deep technical knowledge.
> The C4 Context and Container diagrams in the diagrams folder complement this section visually.

> See also: [C4 Context Diagram](diagrams/c4-context.md) | [C4 Container Diagram](diagrams/c4-container.md)

## System Components

> TODO: List and describe the main components or services that make up the system.
> For each component, describe its responsibility and its boundaries — what it does and what it does not do.

| Component | Responsibility | Type |
|-----------|---------------|------|
| TODO | TODO | Service / Module / Worker / Gateway / etc. |

---

## Technology Stack

> TODO: List the technologies, frameworks, and tools chosen for this project.
> For each choice, provide a brief justification. If the decision was formally recorded, link to the corresponding ADR.
> Remove rows that do not apply.

| Layer | Technology | Justification | ADR |
|-------|------------|---------------|-----|
| Language | TODO | TODO | — |
| Framework | TODO | TODO | — |
| Database | TODO | TODO | — |
| Cache | TODO | TODO | — |
| Message Broker | TODO | TODO | — |
| Authentication | TODO | TODO | — |
| Infrastructure | TODO | TODO | — |
| CI/CD | TODO | TODO | — |
| Monitoring | TODO | TODO | — |

## External Integrations

> TODO: List all external systems, APIs, or services this project depends on.
> Describe the nature of the integration and the communication protocol used.

| System | Purpose | Protocol | Direction |
|--------|---------|----------|-----------|
| TODO | TODO | REST / gRPC / Event / SDK / etc. | Inbound / Outbound / Both |

---

## Data Flow

> TODO: Describe how data flows through the system at a high level.
> Focus on the most critical or complex flows — how a key user action travels from entry point to persistence and back.
> Sequence diagrams in the diagrams folder can illustrate these flows visually.

> See also: [Sequence Flows](diagrams/sequence-flows.md)

---

## Deployment Model

> TODO: Describe where and how the system runs in production.
> Include information about hosting environment, containerization, orchestration, regions, and any relevant infrastructure topology.
> Example: "The application runs as a containerized workload on a managed Kubernetes cluster in a single cloud region."

> See also: [Deployment Diagram](diagrams/deployment.md) | [Deployment](12-deployment.md)

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

> TODO: Describe how the following concerns are addressed across the system.
> Remove items that are not applicable to this project.

### Authentication and Authorization

> TODO: Describe the strategy for identifying users and controlling access.
> Detailed treatment is in the security document.

### Error Handling

> TODO: Describe the general approach to handling errors across the system.
> Example: "All services return standardized error responses. Unhandled exceptions are caught at the boundary layer and logged before returning a generic error to the client."

### Logging

> TODO: Describe the logging strategy at the architecture level.
> Detailed treatment is in the observability document.

### Caching

> TODO: Describe where and how caching is applied in the system, if at all.

### Internationalization and Localization

> TODO: Describe whether the system supports multiple languages or regions, and how that is handled. Remove if not applicable.

> TODO: List all ADRs related to this project's architecture.
> Add new entries as decisions are made throughout the project lifecycle.
