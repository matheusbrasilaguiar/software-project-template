# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

> TODO: List what the system must do from the user's or business perspective.
> Each requirement should describe a capability or behavior, not a technical solution.
> Use the format "The system must..." or "The system shall..." for clarity.
> Assign a unique identifier to each requirement (RF-001, RF-002, etc.) to allow traceability.

| ID | Description | Priority | Status |
|----|-------------|----------|--------|
| RF-001 | TODO | High / Medium / Low | Draft / Approved / Implemented |
| RF-002 | TODO | High / Medium / Low | Draft / Approved / Implemented |

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

> TODO: List the quality attributes and constraints the system must satisfy.
> These define how the system performs, not what it does.
> Common categories are listed below — remove the ones that do not apply to your project.

### Performance

> TODO: Describe expected response times, throughput, or load capacity.
> Example: "The system must respond to 95% of requests within 500ms under normal load."

| ID | Description | Priority |
|----|-------------|----------|
| RNF-001 | TODO | High / Medium / Low |

### Scalability

> TODO: Describe how the system should handle growth in users, data, or traffic.
> Example: "The system must support horizontal scaling without changes to the application code."

| ID | Description | Priority |
|----|-------------|----------|
| RNF-002 | TODO | High / Medium / Low |

### Availability and Reliability

> TODO: Describe uptime expectations and fault tolerance requirements.
> Example: "The system must achieve 99.9% uptime measured monthly."

| ID | Description | Priority |
|----|-------------|----------|
| RNF-003 | TODO | High / Medium / Low |

### Security

> TODO: Describe security requirements at a high level. Detailed treatment is in the security document.
> Example: "All data in transit must be encrypted." or "Users must authenticate before accessing any resource."

| ID | Description | Priority |
|----|-------------|----------|
| RNF-004 | TODO | High / Medium / Low |

### Usability and Accessibility

> TODO: Describe expectations for ease of use and accessibility standards, if applicable.
> Example: "The interface must conform to WCAG 2.1 Level AA."

| ID | Description | Priority |
|----|-------------|----------|
| RNF-005 | TODO | High / Medium / Low |

### Maintainability

> TODO: Describe requirements related to code quality, documentation, and ease of future change.
> Example: "The codebase must maintain a minimum test coverage of 80%."

| ID | Description | Priority |
|----|-------------|----------|
| RNF-006 | TODO | High / Medium / Low |

### Compliance and Legal

> TODO: List any regulatory, legal, or standards compliance requirements.
> Example: "The system must comply with LGPD / GDPR for user data handling."

| ID | Description | Priority |
|----|-------------|----------|
| RNF-007 | TODO | High / Medium / Low |

---

## Business Rules

> TODO: List the rules imposed by the business domain that the system must enforce.
> Business rules are not features — they are constraints on how the system must behave.
> Example: "A user cannot place an order if their account has an outstanding balance."
> Assign a unique identifier to each rule (RN-001, RN-002, etc.).

| ID | Description |
|----|-------------|
| RN-001 | TODO |
| RN-002 | TODO |

---

## Technical Constraints

> TODO: List technical limitations or mandatory choices that constrain the solution.
> These may come from the existing infrastructure, team expertise, or integration requirements.
> Example: "The solution must integrate with the existing authentication provider." or "The system must run in a containerized environment."

| # | Constraint | Reason |
|---|------------|--------|
| 1 | TODO | TODO |
| 2 | TODO | TODO |

---

## Requirements Traceability

> TODO: Use this table to map requirements to their origin (stakeholder, document, or decision) and to where they are implemented or tested.
> This section can be filled progressively as the project evolves.

| Requirement ID | Origin | Related ADR | Test Coverage |
|----------------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| RF-001 | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| RNF-001 | TODO | TODO | TODO |
