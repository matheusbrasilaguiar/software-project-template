# Decisions Log

## Overview

> This document provides a lightweight log of technical and product decisions made throughout the project.
> It is intended for teams that do not adopt formal ADRs but still want to maintain a traceable record of significant choices.
> If your project uses ADRs, refer to the [ADR index](adr/README.md) instead.

**When to add an entry:**
- A decision that affects how a feature is built or how the system is structured
- A choice between two or more meaningful alternatives
- A trade-off that future team members would need context to understand
- Any decision that was deliberately made and is not self-evident from the code

**Format:** Keep entries short and factual. Focus on context and reasoning, not implementation details.
