# Design

## Overview

> **⚠️ OPTIONAL SECTION — Delete if not applicable.**
> This folder is intended for projects that have a dedicated design phase: UI/UX screens, prototypes, wireframes, or a design system.
> **If your project is a back-end API, CLI tool, library, or any project without a user interface, delete this entire `docs/design/` folder** and remove its reference from `mkdocs.yml` and `docs/index.md`.

> TODO: Describe the design approach for this project.
> Is there a dedicated design system? Are wireframes or prototypes available?
> Example: "This project follows a mobile-first design approach. All screens were prototyped in Figma before implementation."
