# Glossary

## Overview

> TODO: This document defines the terms used throughout this project's documentation and codebase.
> A shared vocabulary reduces ambiguity and aligns all stakeholders — developers, product owners, and business teams — around the same understanding of the domain.
> This is especially important in projects that follow Domain-Driven Design (DDD), where the ubiquitous language is a core practice.

**How to use this glossary:**
- Add a term whenever a word or concept has a specific meaning within this project that differs from its common usage or requires clarification.
- Keep definitions concise and written from the business domain perspective, not the technical implementation perspective.
- If a term has a synonym or an alias used elsewhere, document it.
- Terms are listed in alphabetical order.
